  <p>Data Analyst focused on cultural resource management with four years of experience in libraries, archives, museums, and higher education. 
    Graduated magna cum laude from a Tier One Research University with a B.A. in History and Social Justice. 
    Postgraduate certificate in Data Visualization and Analytics. 
    Rational, reliable, and resourceful problem solver who seeks challenges and learns quickly. 
    Skilled in Python (Pandas, Numpy, SciPy, Requests, JSON libraries), SQL and NoSQL databases, and web visualization tools including D3.js, Leaflet.js, and Tableau. 
    Passionate about collections stewardship, data accessibility, and dataâ€™s influence on local public policy. 
    My professional background in libraries, archives, and museums has taught me excellent organizational skills from experts in the oldest information field in academia - librarianship, 
    as well as the critical importance of good documentation for data retrieval, 
    and how to balance attention to detail with the big picture to tell an accurate and compelling story.
